# Embracing Vulnerability - A Story of Overcoming Fear and Reclaiming Identity

_I feel lonely. I stand naked amidst vast darkness, my only companions faint lights in the distance. The lights, however, seem to grow dimmer regardless of my attempts to approach them. Coldness seeps into my being, warmth drains from my fingers, and I can no longer discern the texture of my own body. Numbness reigns. Silence pervades._

## Early Childhood

As a child, I was invariably shy and introverted. My mother often used to say that I didn't cry at birth and that tears were an uncommon occurrence even afterwards. I don't recall much from that period of my life.

## Coping with Illness

A significant health scare invaded my world early on. At the tender age of four, I was diagnosed with acute leukemia. The subsequent nine months were spent in a hospital, as my survival hung in the balance. I like to humorously claim that this was my second birth.

The ordeal was taxing for my mother and brother, but I remember experiencing more perplexity than profound negativity. The most disheartening emotion I can recall is sadness, a consequence of quarantine and being barred from outdoor play.

I've read that the period from ages four to six is crucial for learning social skills. Given that, I wonder if my social awkwardness and struggle to communicate effectively can be traced back to my illness.

## Social Struggles and Family Dynamics

Following my discharge from the hospital, I remember I still wasn't allowed to venture outside. My new playground was our garden. The first friend I made post-release was a girl from the other side of the fence. I didn't know how to make friends, but children at that age rarely exhibit shyness or judgment, so we somehow became friends. This pattern continued, and I managed to make a few more friends before I could play outside freely.

Around this time, my mother found a new boyfriend. My stepdad, who had been a pillar of support when even my mothers family failed, became a central figure in our lives. Initially, I liked him and considered him my real father. But that has changed fairly quickly.

As the years went by, I made many friends in our small village of about 500 residents. I could never comprehend why some children didn't want to interact with others. I had never experienced that, and my young mind struggled to grasp such behavior.

## Nerd of the Village

People can be complex; electronics, in contrast, are much simpler. I became the village main nerd, frequently dismantling devices out of curiosity. Slowly, I found myself engrossed in the realm of electronics and the digital world, an environment where leveling up a character seemed far easier than real personal growth.

## Moving to City School

When I transitioned to a city school, my social awkwardness became painfully apparent. Even entering a shop alone invoked fear. Speaking to girls was an insurmountable challenge. My mouth moved, but no sound emerged. I didn't realize at the time that I was experiencing social anxiety and panic attacks.

I made a few friends, but none of the connections ran particularly deep. From my perspective, it felt as though we were merely tolerating each other's presence. Consequently, I retreated further into the digital realm.

## New Village, New Problems

A few years later, we relocated to a different village near the city. The neighboring village kids, with whom I shared the school bus, were particularly mean. Naturally soft-hearted, I stood out and became their target, enduring bullying for the next four years or so.

This was the period when my relationship with my stepfather soured. His emotional manipulations and aggressive behavior made me feel inadequate and incompetent. Endless shaming at his hands left deep, painful scars.

From then on, I adopted the persona of a frightened cat. I struggle to believe in myself and often overthink. I easily get scared and afraid. To counter this, I've cultivated a facade of fake confidence.

## Finding a Friend in Patrick

One boy, Patrick, took a stand for me against the bullies. In time, we became best friends. Our relationship shaped my teenage years and, to an extent, molded who I am. We were like brothers, sharing nearly every waking moment and both our joys and sorrows. Nothing seemed capable of separating us.

## Loss and Isolation

However, this illusion shattered when Patrick announced he would be moving to the other side of the Czech Republic. My world fragmented into countless pieces. I lost a part of who I was, a chunk of my identity. More critically, I learned how those closest to me could inflict profound pain.

After Patrick's departure, I didn't seek other friendships. It felt pointless. My dog became my closest companion, and I spent my days gaming and watching anime and porn. This was when people started to express difficulties understanding me. Little did they know I faced the same issue with them.

I believed only humans could hurt me, but I learned even animals could cause heartache. When we had to move from our house to a small apartment in a different city, we couldn't bring Ali, my canine friend, with us. The loss tore into my already wounded heart. The person I became after losing Patrick and Ali differed starkly from who I was before.

## High School and Persona Crafting

This transition also marked my entrance to high school. Keen on fitting in, I made it my mission to blend. Since the age of nine, I had been reading psychological books in an effort to understand people. Implementing strategies from these books, I managed to make some friends and even start dating. I felt victorious, albeit myopic, and began to identify with this artificially constructed persona. In retrospect, it wasn't the best decision.

## Emotional Struggles

I've always struggled with emotions, often becoming overly emotional very quickly. Although this felt normal to me, others found it off-putting. Hence, I learned to conceal my emotional side. Ironically, people started labeling me as cold and heartless.

I believed that by suppressing my emotions and demonstrating my intellect, people would like me. To an extent, it worked; people appreciated my merits. However, this wasn't truly what I sought. At that point, even I wasn't fully aware of what I wanted.

Gradually, I felt a void growing within me. I lost sight of who I was, hidden behind numerous masks. The face I saw in the mirror was no longer recognizable.

## A Hollow Shell

Towards the end of high school, I made a terrible mistake which led to my mother kicking me out of the house. Basically losing her, the most important person in my life until then, I felt I had lost a significant part of myself. The guilt made me feel like a ghost, a hollow shell devoid of a human soul.

## Breaking Relationships

A few years post-graduation, the void within me morphed into a black hole, threatening to drain my very essence. Desperation drove me to the brink of contemplating suicide. In a desperate bid for relief, I broke up with my girlfriend and stopped seeing and looking after my daughter. The guilt was immense.

Confused and rudderless, I wasn't sure what was right or wrong, what to do next. Despite the guilt, I also felt a sense of relief. It was as though I could breathe again, gradually reclaiming my lost soul. I didn't realize then that severing ties would provide temporary peace, but ultimately alienate me further, leaving me lonelier than before.

## A New Girlfriend and Polyamory

Feeling lonely once more, I didn't wait long before I found a new girlfriend. She was kind and loving, but my heart remained firmly shut. Despite my need for love, I couldn't feel or reciprocate it. Hoping that more love might solve the issue, I adopted polyamory and started dating a close friend. However, this arrangement soon became unbearable for all involved, and we broke up. The guilt returned, stronger than ever.

I felt like an abject failure, a human disaster causing pain to everyone around me. I seemed like a raging fire, harming anyone who dared come close. Was I even capable of love? The feeling seemed distant and unfamiliar. I felt like a self-destructing sun, burning out.

## The Dream of Travelling

Since I was about eight, my biggest dream was to travel the world. Until recently, I was certain I wanted to travel alone, preferring solitude and undisturbed exploration. But now, as this dream nears fruition, I'm filled with sadness. A realization hit me when I was mulling over this earlier – I've been lonely for a long time. I don't want to travel alone. I long to share beautiful moments, laughter, and tears with someone. I yearn to feel as safe in someone's presence as I felt in my mother's arms as a child. I no longer want to don masks to gain acceptance. Instead, I want to bare my true self, no matter how frightening it may be.

## Conclusion

While I'm still uncertain of who I truly am, or if I'll ever fully understand myself, I do know my feelings are the most tangible things I've ever experienced. I believe there's immense beauty within me and life itself. I want to open my eyes and keep them open, even if it occasionally causes discomfort. Only with open eyes can I truly see the person in front of me, and in the reflection of their eyes, see myself.

This article serves no other purpose than to bare my life and emotions – the ugly truths I've concealed for as long as I can remember.

I realize now that some may interpret this as a desperate cry for help. Maybe that's just my internal critic being overly judgmental. Regardless, even if it were a plea for help, I believe there's great strength in asking for aid. Failures aren't inherently negative, and weaknesses aren't definitive.

I wish you a beautiful day.
